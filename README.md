# how to open the project

1 -  `git clone https://github.com/sinaneturk/pardon-app-case.git`<br />
2 - `npm instal`<br />
3 - `npm start`<br />
4 - visit the url that `npm start` command gives away . This will open the app on port 3000 , but for some reasonif that port is in use then you should use `npm start --port 8080` . Here 8080is just a placeholder , feel free to use any available port .
